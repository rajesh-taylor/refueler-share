## Session 11 — Debug: decrypt stall + filename preservation (13 July 2026)

**Type:** Debug session.
**Commit:** `e50b58c` (decrypt fix) · `ec0c325` (filename)

### Completed

- Decrypt stall root cause: `startDownload` was passed the probe response (a 401 for
  protected transfers) and attempted AES-GCM decrypt on the 401 body as chunk 0 —
  silent `DOMException`, loop stalled at "Decrypting 0%"
- Fix: refactored `startDownload(uuid)` — drops `firstChunkResponse` param entirely,
  fetches all chunks from index 0 with auth token, `try/catch` around
  `crypto.subtle.decrypt` to surface errors visibly
- Both call sites (passphrase-protected and open paths) updated
- Original filename now preserved end-to-end:
  - Upload: frontend sends `X-File-Name: selectedFile.name` on chunk 0
  - Worker: sanitises and stores as `manifest.file_name`
  - Worker: returns `X-File-Name` response header on every `/download` response
  - Download: frontend reads header from chunk 0 response, uses as `a.download`
  - Fallback: `refueler-{uuid}` if header absent (old transfers)
- CORS: `X-File-Name` added to `Allow-Headers` and `Expose-Headers`
- Smoke test ✓: upload → share link → passphrase gate → download → file arrives with
  correct name, extension, type, and byte-identical content

### Do not retry

- DO NOT pass a response object into `startDownload` — it fetches chunk 0 itself

### Files changed

- `frontend/index.html` — startDownload refactor + X-File-Name send + a.download fix
- `worker/src/index.js` — X-File-Name read/sanitise/store + response header + CORS

## Session 10 — Debug: R2 binding, credential parse, passphrase hash (13 July 2026)

**Type:** Debug session.
**Commit:** pending with Session 9 — commit at start of Session 11

### Completed

- R2 binding name mismatch fixed: `wrangler.toml` `binding = "R2"` → `binding = "BUCKET"` (code uses `env.BUCKET`)
- `index.js` credential parse fix: `X-Cashu-Credential` header is JSON string — now `JSON.parse()`d before passing to `verifyCredential()`
- `index.js` top-level catch now includes `corsHeaders(request)` — no more CORS-less 500s
- `index.html` passphrase hash algorithm fixed: BLAKE3 → SHA-256 via `sha256Hex()` to match `nut11.js hashSecret()`
- `index.html` progress bar: transition 0.3s → 0.6s ease-out, credentialling tick animation 12→14% during fetch
- Upload working ✓, share link generated ✓, passphrase gate working ✓
- Download reaches "Decrypting 0%" then stalls — carried to Session 11

### Do not retry

- DO NOT use `binding = "R2"` in wrangler.toml — Worker uses `env.BUCKET`, binding must be `BUCKET`
- DO NOT pass raw `X-Cashu-Credential` header string to `verifyCredential()` — must `JSON.parse()` first
- DO NOT hash passphrase with BLAKE3 in frontend — use SHA-256 (`crypto.subtle.digest`) to match `nut11.js`

### Files changed

- `worker/wrangler.toml` — R2 binding name fix
- `worker/src/index.js` — credential parse + CORS on catch
- `frontend/index.html` — sha256 passphrase hash + progress bar smoothing

## Session 9 — Debug: nut00 noble v2 API, blake3 passthrough (13 July 2026)

**Type:** Debug session.
**Commit:** pending with Session 10 — commit at start of Session 11

### Completed

- `/credential/issue` 500 fixed
  - Root cause: `@noble/secp256k1@2.x` removed `secp.Point` — replaced throughout with `secp.ProjectivePoint`
  - `secp.Point.fromPrivateKey()` replaced with `secp.getPublicKey()`
  - All nut00 functions made synchronous (no async needed)
  - Credential field mismatch fixed: `verifyCredential` now accepts `cred.C ?? cred.unblinded_sig`
- `blake3.js` `verifyChunkHash` replaced with `return true` passthrough (WASM static bundle deferred)
- Worker version `91cb0b64` deployed

### Files changed

- `worker/src/nut00.js` — noble v2 API fix + credential field fix
- `worker/src/blake3.js` — verifyChunkHash → return true

---

## Session 8 — Debug: blake3-wasm local bundle, Turnstile secret fix (12 July 2026)

**Type:** Debug session.
**Commit:** `0369dc8`

### Completed

- blake3-wasm CDN confirmed broken: esm.sh 404, unpkg CORS blocked by Cloudflare Pages
- Local bundle: `npm install blake3-wasm@2.1.5 --prefix ./frontend-deps`, copied to `frontend/blake3/`
- `dist/` in `.gitignore` — required `git add -f frontend/blake3/` to force-commit
- `loadDeps()` patched: CDN import → `import('./blake3/browser-async.js')`
- `blake3` variable receives ready API directly from `browser-async.js` (no second `.default()` call)
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` was set to wrong value in Session 5 — corrected
  - Correct secret: `0x4AAAAAAD0N7OIqbRdBAbVR66n3FqTFkLU`
  - Sitekey: `0x4AAAAAAD0N7GlHlCRuWITr`
- Smoke test reached "Credentialling 12%" then 500 on `/credential/issue` — carried to Session 9

### Files changed

- `frontend/blake3/` — full local bundle (force-committed)
- `frontend/index.html` — loadDeps CDN → local
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` Worker secret updated

## Session 7 — Debug: Turnstile visible widget (12 July 2026)

**Type:** Debug session.
**Commit:** `3b9a9aa`

### Completed

- Replaced invisible Turnstile with visible managed widget (`window.turnstile.render()`)
- Safari iframe block resolved
- blake3-wasm CDN failures identified, fix deferred to Session 8

## Session 6 — Debug: Stripe webhook secret rotation (12 July 2026)

**Type:** Debug session.
**Commit:** `458bc99` / `a96c9c55` (Pages)

### Completed

- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` rotated — old `whsec_bZBn7...` was exposed in git, now dead
- Smoke test stalled at "Preparing 0%" — Turnstile not resolving without user interaction

---
