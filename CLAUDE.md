## What this repo is

`refueler-share` is an anonymous, encrypted peer-to-peer file transfer system.
Files are chunked, BLAKE3-hashed for integrity, stored on Cloudflare R2, and access is gated by Cashu blind-signature tokens settled via Lightning (BOLT11).

**Fastest path to market.** Likely R&D funding source for the wider Refueler ecosystem.

**Local path:** `/Users/rajeshtaylor/Documents/refueler-share/`
**GitHub:** `rajesh-taylor/refueler-share` (public)
**Licence:** Apache 2.0

## Architectural lock

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Chunk indexing & verification | BLAKE3 | Internal only — content addressing, integrity checks |
| Anonymous authentication | Cashu blind signatures | Access tokens, payment gate |
| Storage | Cloudflare R2 | Egress-free object store |
| Payment | Blink BOLT11 | Upload capacity settled via Lightning |

**These two layers must never be conflated.** BLAKE3 is not the auth layer. Cashu is not the hashing layer.

## Locked decisions

- No custodial wallet. Payment settled externally via Blink.
- Cloudflare Worker receives and stores encrypted noise — it cannot read file content.
- Pricing/unit economics are never published in this repo (stripped CC-64).
- Apache 2.0 licence — patent grant clause protects the novel BLAKE3 + Cashu combination.
